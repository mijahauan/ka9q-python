---

### `tune_example.py`

**What it does**: Demonstrates programmatic channel tuning (changing frequency).

**Concepts demonstrated**:
- Using `tune()` method for frequency changes
- Waiting for channel verification
- Dynamic frequency control

**Run it**:
```bash
python3 examples/tune_example.py
```

**Expected output**: Creates a channel and tunes it to different frequencies, showing the tuning process.

---

### `tune.py`

**What it does**: Interactive command-line utility for tuning channels (Python implementation of ka9q-radio's `tune`).

**Concepts demonstrated**:
- Interactive channel control
- Real-time frequency adjustment
- Command-line argument parsing

**Run it**:
```bash

- PLL configuration for carrier tracking
- SNR-based squelch
- Independent Sideband (ISB) mode
- Secondary filter configuration
- Opus encoding
- Spectrum analyzer mode
- RF hardware controls
- And many more advanced features

**Run it**:

## Diagnostics

The `diagnostics/` subdirectory contains utilities for troubleshooting and testing.

---

## Tips for Using Examples

1. **Replace the radiod address**: Most examples use `"bee1-hf-status.local"` as the default. Replace this with your own `radiod` instance address.

2. **Check for active channels**: Before running stream examples, ensure at least one channel is active on `radiod`. Use `discover_example.py` to check.

3. **Multi-homed systems**: If you have multiple network interfaces, you may need to specify the `interface` parameter when creating `RadiodControl`.

4. **Read the code**: Each example is heavily commented. Reading the source code is the best way to understand how things work.

5. **Experiment**: Modify the examples to suit your needs. Change frequencies, presets, sample rates, and other parameters to see how they affect behavior.
